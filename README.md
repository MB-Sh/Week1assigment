# Week1assigment
Build a website similar to https://spacey-kappa.vercel.app/ using html and css thought in week 1 of Software Dev Bootcamp

Week 1 was quite tough, especially for a novice like me. 
I had a bit of a technical setback, which was eventually resolved. I struggled to catch up with some of the lessons and workshops, especially remembering the codes, even though I spent time in the evenings studying. 
However, it's still early days, and I look forward to getting better at it. 
I am super grateful for the little victories, and many thanks to my tutors.
